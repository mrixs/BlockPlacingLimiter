Hello, everybody!
It's readme for BlockPlacingLimiter, plugin for CraftBukkit(minecraft server).

And now I'll tell you how to configure my plugin.

Example:

#   enable: true
#   blocks:
#     blocks:
#     - 1
#     - 2
#     - 25
#     - 50
#     number:
#     - 3
#     - 5
#     - 0
#     - 7

You can enable/disable plugin by setiing "enable" in first string to "true" or "false"
Next you can set limits for various blocks. In that example
block with ID = 1 has limit = 3,
block with ID = 2 has limit = 5,
block with ID = 25 has no limit (zero is unlimited),
block with ID = 50 has limit = 7,
other blocks are unlimited.

!!! In this version it counts only blocks that has been placed or removed while plugin is enabled.
